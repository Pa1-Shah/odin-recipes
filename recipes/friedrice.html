        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> As many cooks in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Korea know, day-old cooked rice is best for stir fried rice dishes. It's a little dried out so it doesnâ€™t get clumpy when you return it to heat. </p>
        <p> If you don't have rice already made and need to make some for this dish, use a bit less water than usual and let it cook until it is quite dry so that the grains stay separated. </p>
        <p> If you have both time and forethought, you can also spread out freshly cooked rice on a dishtowel or cookie tray and leave it uncovered for an hour or two so that it dries out somewhat. </p>
        <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided </li>
            <li>1 cup broccoli crowns and stems </li>
            <li>1 cup chopped carrots </li>
            <li>1 cup diced zucchini </li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste </li>
            <li>3 cups  cooked and cooled white or brown rice </li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil, regular or spicy </li>
            <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts, plus more for garnish </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons finely minced garlic </li>
        </ul>
        <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
            <li> Cook the veggies: Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and then the broccoli, carrots, cabbage, zucchini, peppers, and edamame. </li>
            <li> Scramble the eggs:Season the beaten eggs with a little salt and pepper. Heat 1 more tablespoon of oil in the same wok or skillet over high heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble quickly, just about 1 minute. When they are just cooked through, slide them out onto the plate with the vegetables. </li>
            <li> Stir fry the rice:<ul>
                <li>Return the wok to the burner over high heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the cooled rice . Stir fry, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes. </li>
                <li> Return the wok to the burner over high heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the cooled rice . Stir fry, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Finish the stir fry: Return the vegetables and eggs to the wok with the rice. Cook, stirring often, until everything is combined and hot and the vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper, if needed. </li>
            <li> Garnish and serve: Sprinkle the additional scallions over the top, and serve right away, passing soy sauce on the side for those who want a bit more. </li>
        </ol>
