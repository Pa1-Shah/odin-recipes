        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Chicken Wings are so easy to prepare with a handful of ingredients. </p>
        <p>Simple but delicious, these crispy wings are baked in the oven instead of fried in oil. </p>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, combine the baking powder, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken wings and toss until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Spread the wings into an even layer on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake for 20 minutes until the skins are golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F on an instant-read thermometer. Let cool for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Transfer the wings to a large mixing bowl, reserving the drippings. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together melted butter and reserved drippings. Add the butter mixture to the bowl with the chicken wings, tossing to coat. Serve immediately</li>
